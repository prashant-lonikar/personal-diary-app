## Technologies Used
- React
- HTML5
- CSS3
- localStorage for data persistence

## Pros and Cons

### Pros:
- Simple and easy to use
- No server required; runs entirely in the browser
- Can be used offline once loaded
- Free to host on GitHub Pages

### Cons:
- Data is stored locally, so entries are not synced across devices
- Limited storage capacity due to localStorage limitations
- Password protection is basic and not highly secure
- No backup functionality built-in

## Future Improvements
- Implement cloud storage for cross-device synchronization
- Enhance security features
- Add data export/import functionality for backups
- Implement tags or categories for entries
